      <description>Prelude After decades of coding, even worse, like many heavy Emacs user, I nearly don&amp;rsquo;t move my hands away from keyboard.
I&amp;rsquo;m suffering from RSI (repetitive strain injury) problem.
I have tried some ergonomic keyboards, like Goldtouch Adjustable, Infinity Ergodox, Model01. (Xah Lee have reviews of them.) However, the RSI still stay with me.
As a asian, I have small hands. The ergonomic keyboards I used still require me to twist wrist.</description>

      <description>When I upgrade NixOS of for my mini-server with:
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade It&amp;rsquo;ll download tons of packages from http://nixos-cache.example.com/ which is unbearable slow. Then I tried to build some of them instead of download the prebuild version1:
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --option substitute false However, the SSD of the mini-server have only 5G. The upgrade failed when building gcc.
I have a server with socks5 proxy, which can access the cache.</description>
